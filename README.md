   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ticketing-system.git
   cd ticketing-system

2. Install PHP dependencies

   composer install

3. Install JavaScript dependencies

   npm install

4. Copy environment file and update values

   copy .env.example .env

   Update the following values in `.env` to match your environment:

   DB_DATABASE=ticketing_system
   DB_USERNAME=your_username
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password

   BROADCAST_DRIVER=reverb
   REVERB_APP_ID=123456

   (In production consider setting REVERB_SCHEME=https and using secure credentials.)

5. Generate application key

   php artisan key:generate

6. Run migrations and seeders

   php artisan migrate --seed

   The seeder creates sample accounts for testing:

   - Admin: admin@example.com / password
   - Customer: customer@example.com / password

7. Start development servers

   Start Laravel backend (default port 8000):

   php artisan serve

   Start Vite frontend (separate terminal):

   npm run dev

## üí¨ Real-time chat behaviour

- Messages are ordered from oldest ‚Üí newest (created_at ascending).
- Real-time transport: Reverb + Echo broadcast events (TicketChatSent).


## üîí Security

- Authentication: Laravel Sanctum for SPA and API token auth.
- Authorization: role-based checks for channels and ticket access.
- Use HTTPS (REVERB_SCHEME=https) and secure credentials in production.

---

## üêû Troubleshooting

- Reverb not connecting: ensure REVERB_HOST and REVERB_PORT match the running Reverb instance and the port is free.
- Real-time issues: check the browser console, Reverb debug output, and `storage/logs/laravel.log`.
- API errors: confirm DB credentials, run `php artisan migrate --seed` and check `config/database.php`.
